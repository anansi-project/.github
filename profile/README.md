# The Anansi Project

## What is it?

The Anansi Project is an initiative to bring structure and cohesion to the world of metadata for Comic Books, Mangas, and other graphic novels.

The basic premise of this project is that the current state of things is inadequate. There are multiple existing formats (ComicRack, ComicBookInfo, ACBF, CoMetâ€¦) and initiatives (OPDS Page Streaming Extension), but most of them don't have a clear specification and/or governance. The end result is that all producing/consuming applications are forced to support multiple formats, often with different interpretation due to the lack of specification, and with limiting capabilities as none of the format can handle all the use cases.
